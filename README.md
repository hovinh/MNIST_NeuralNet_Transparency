# Observations

## Dataset
MNIST is too simple in terms of pattern that there is no significant change in determining the factors contributing to the prediction when number of sampling increases. Thus, for this kind of dataset, 1000 sampling per prediction is adequate.

## Experiment
### Model 1: Neural Network with no hidden layer
- Architecture: input layer -> softmax -> output layer
- The plot of weight seems randomly uniform, no clear patter suggest a correlation to
